## Skills

**User experience 👌**

A keen eye for detail and an understanding that design and engaging user journeys are crucial to satisfy today's consumers. I've had leading hands-on experience in the user experience design of all projects I've been involved in.

**MVP and prototypes 💡**

From customer development through to final product, I develop beautifully designed, user-friendly minimum viable products, wireframes and prototypes.

**Product ownership 🙋‍**

Strategic thinking, getting things done, analysing data & making decisions, influencing others positively. I've worked with small and larger design teams, internal and external. I have a technical background and am very comfortable working with product teams.

**Team building 🔨**

I built a team of 7 (5 full time) from scratch at Sian's Plan and have hired at the majority of my previous roles. Engineers, designers and in operations. Externally I've briefed, sourced, interviewed and worked with a number of fantastic development and design contractors and agencies.

**Solutions driven 🏁**

My natural curiosity & engineering background has taught me that problems are always solvable. Plan B, C, D or E aren't far away.

**Business development 🤝**

We developed partnerships with all the major retailers in the UK (eg. Tesco), Eumom.ie (Irelands largest parenting website) and established working relationships with The Guardian & Unilever.

**Fundraising 💸**

I didn't know where to start when I set out with Sian's Plan but after plenty of introductions, meetings, rejections(!) and investment I've built a good network and understanding of what investors need.
